# Traktor Key Converter
#### For Converting 

This script will read a Traktor collection file 
and convert all keys to the Camelot scale, used by Mixed in Key.

It has only been tested on collection files created by Traktor Pro 2.6.1 and higher.

Compile with GroovyWrapper from within the src directory: groovy GroovyWrapper.groovy -m TraktorKeyConverter

Running the script:
move the jar file created by the wrapper to the directory where your Traktor collection file is located.
run: java -jar TraktorKeyConverter.jar
